## Approach

<<<<<<< HEAD
The idea from the beginning was to create a specialised network site for IT professionals. 
Me and my team wrote up user stories and wireframes using Miro:
![miro-screen](./readme-assets/miro-screen.png)

I took the lead on the social aspect of the site, including filtering, show/hide comments, tags, CRUD posts and comments, both on the frontend and backend. I also contributed to the home page, the middleware on the backend, the footer, about us page, login, register and logout.

In total, I completed 12 of 28 issues ~ 43% + initial technical installations, Git and Jira setups.

## Bugs, Wins & Learnings
Many features that were stretch goals were not finished, including a search for the whole site.
It was a great project and there are a throve of features that can be added to make it a proper product. 

Working in a team is fun and can get a lot done when the group is in sync. 
I learned quite a bit about react, router, state and Bulma on this project. 

A good idea was to keep updating the front end with a time interval:
```
  const getPostData = async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.get(`${baseUrl}/posts/`,
      {
        headers: { "authorization": `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("token")}` },
      })
    setAllUserPosts(data)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    getPostData()
    setInterval(() => {
      getPostData()
    }, 2000);
  }, [])
  ```

  That way the user will see up-to-date data.

  Deleting comments and posts in real time using state also drastically improves the UX.

  I also added a show/hide button for the comments so the feed doesn't clutter.
