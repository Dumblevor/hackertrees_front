## Approach

The idea from the beginning was to create a specialised professional network site for IT professionals. 
Me and my team wrote up user stories and wireframes using Miro:

I took the lead on the social aspect of the site, including filtering, show/hide comments, tags, CRUD posts and comments, both on the fronend and backend. I also contributed to the home page, the middleware on the backend, the footer, about us page, login, register and logout. 


## Timeline
- Day 1 - Brainstorming & wireframes, user stories, pseudo models
- Day 2 - Boiler plate setup, Git setup, Jira, start of Sprint 1
- Day 4 - End of sprint 1, start of sprint 2
- Day 6 - End of sprint 2
- Day 7 - Deployment

In total I completed 12 of 28 issues ~ 43% + initial teachnical, Git and Jira setups.

## Bugs, Wins & Learnings
Many features that were stretch goals were not finished, including search for the whole site, filtering by tags, upvotes for posts.
It was a great project and there is a throve of features that can be added to make it a proper product. 

Working in team is fun and can get a lot done when the group is in sync. 
I personally learned quite a bit about react, router, state and bulma on this project.
